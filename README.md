# JavaScript-Calculator
A Simple calculator using: JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

In this simple looking calculator we use basic calculation logic to make our simple operations come to life.

In order to run this application. download the file and open the index file. This will take you to a browser and run the script file automatically. 

If you are looking to create your own. I urge you to create your own CSS styling to make it more unique. My styling is not perfect but it is highly functional. 

Enjoy and Happy Coding.
